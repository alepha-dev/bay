/**
 * Creates the one operator account, once, at first boot.
 *
 * bay-admin has no sign-up form and no way to send a mail, so an account has
 * to exist before anyone can log in. This is that account.
 *
 * **The password is generated, not `admin`.** bay-admin is reachable over
 * HTTPS from anywhere and can deploy code, read every hosted app's secrets and
 * delete every backup. A well-known default on a panel like that is found by a
 * scanner in hours, and the window is not "until the operator changes it" — it
 * is "from first boot", before anyone has logged in even once.
 *
 * That is the same reasoning that removed Bay's TCP control token: a shared
 * secret that has to travel is a secret that leaks. Shipping `admin:admin`
 * here would put a worse one back.
 *
 * The generated password is printed **once**, at `warn`, on the boot that
 * creates the account. An operator running `bay deploy` is already on the
 * host; reading one line of `journalctl` is not the hard part of setting up a
 * server.
 *
 * Set `BAY_ADMIN_PASSWORD` to choose it instead — for an automated install,
 * or for someone who wants a known value. It is used only when the account is
 * created; changing it later does nothing, because at that point the password
 * lives hashed in the database and the profile page is how it changes.
