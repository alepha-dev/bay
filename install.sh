# Installs the `bay` binary and creates the directory layout described in
# INSTALL.md. It deliberately stops there: steps 3 to 5 of that guide
# (the systemd unit, the base domain, the ACME email, the deploy group) need
# decisions this script cannot make for you, and a `curl | sh` has no business
# putting a public reverse proxy on :80 and :443 without being asked.
#
# Re-running it upgrades in place: the binary is replaced atomically and, if a
# `bay` service is already running, restarted.
#
# Environment:
#   BAY_VERSION   release tag to install, or "latest" (default)
#   BAY_PREFIX    install root (default /opt/bay)
#   BAY_BIN_LINK  symlink to put on PATH (default /usr/local/bin/bay)
